Process:

1. Refer to the user documentation of a Windows command prompt, Apple terminal, or Linux terminal to clone a repository.
2. Clone all the Java files from the footybettor_GUI folder into a local folder from the FootyBettor repository on GitHub.
3. After completion of cloning, download the MAMP. Start the MAMP and get the MySQL port number 8889 in the preferences.
4. Set up the connection in the DB browser in IntelliJ with the port number 8889, user "root," and password "root."
5. Set up the Jar dependency in Modules in Project Structure in IntelliJ with the downloaded MySQL connector jar file.
6. After connecting to the database, compile the java files to make sure everything is functional and then run the Main.java file to launch the program.
7. After launching the program, follow the sequential instructions on GUI windows and enjoy betting!

Please note, the user does not have to download any external libraries or packages in order to run the betting program, only the files provided within the footybettor_GUI folder in the main branch of the repository on GitHub.
